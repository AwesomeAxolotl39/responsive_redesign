        <p class="text-center">This is the website for the Rooute66 Restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine. I chose this
            website is because I
            think it is too busy and distracting, and, in particular, the size of the website header and the plethora of
            large, bright photos
            makes it hard and awkward to see what else is on the page.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Useability Issues with Original Site</h3>
        <h5>Learnability</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The size of the header in relation to the navigation bar makes it hard for the user to find what they
                are looking for.</li>
            <li>When one first enters website, the header takes up half the screen and large images take up the other
                half of the screen,
                so there is no indication that one should scroll down.</li>
            <li>There are a few instances where the text is a different color and it seems like it should be a link to
                something
                (e.g. the email address, phone number, address, etc), but there are no links, which is confusing</li>
            <li>Some of the pictures have like buttons, but nothing happens when the button is clicked</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Memorability</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>When the user hovers over a picture, it darkens, which makes it seem like something is going to happen.
                However,
                nothing does, but the darkening of the images make it hard to remember not to do this</li>
            <li>Some of the links do not work (e.g. instagram), but the icons are still there, which makes it hard to
                remember not
                to click on them</li>
            <li>When visiting the website on an iPad, the edges get cut off, so if someone is used to using it on a
                computer
                and then goes to the website on an iPad, it could be hard for them to remember where to find what they
                need and
                complete certain tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Efficiency</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The “contact us” section is at the very bottom left corner, and one can only get to it after scrolling
                through many large
                images.
            </li>
            <li>The links to instagram, yelp, trip advisor, etc are practically invisible against the backdrop of the
                pictures.
            </li>
            <li>The plethora of large, bright photos that take up most of the home page make it hard to find the parts
                of the website
                with actual information (menu, contact info, etc).
            </li>
            <li>It has a lot of information repeated in different format throughout the website, so it hard to remember
                where to find the
                information that one wants.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Accessability</h5>
        <p>The main issues that WAIVE found with the original website were errors due to empty links and bad contrast,
            as well as a lot of “suspicious alternative text.” Given that issues that I found with the site were also
            related to
            missing links and text that was quite hard to read, I definitely agree with the detected problems.</p>
